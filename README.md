IT Fornebu lunch app for Android
=================================
by Marius Haugli Kristensen

Description
---------------------------------
Just an app for displayin the lunch menu at IT Fornebu. It's based on screenscraping the (IT Fornebu homepage)[http://leietaker.itfornebu.no/itfornebu/kantinemeny] which unfortunately don't update at a regular interval (if updated at all). But this is as close I could get.

Implementation
---------------------------------
I've tried to implement this app using WebView. I find it easier to style and make a HTML page compatible with different sizes easier than using ContentView. But the cost may be a bit slower application.

To do
---------------------------------
- Add a about screen + button.
- Replace spinner with something more fun.
- Possibly a check to find what day it is and highlight that day in some way.
